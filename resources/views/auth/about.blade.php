                    <h2>Our People &amp; Culture</h2>
                    <p>HubSpotters make our company what it is. We hire for inbound aptitude over experience, and we pride ourselves on attracting and retaining people with HEART. We also believe in radical transparency, so we publicly shared <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love">HubSpot’s Culture Code</a> for anyone who was interested in our values and approach to work. At the core of what drives us is one simple phrase, “Solve For The Customer.” This maniacal focus is more than a mantra; putting the customer first is evident in the product we ship, the support we provide, and the way we market and sell. And doing so makes us deliriously happy.</p>
